## Short description: 
In this project we will by the use of Python and Data Science answer the following problem: Throughout the years, equality in education has been put under debate. How are the general equality patterns shown in the industries and how are the salaries estimated to develop in the future?

### The dataset used to answer this question:
https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/datasets/csv/graduates/graduates.csv

## List of used technologies:
- Numpy, Pandas, DataFrame, Matplotlib, Clustering of data through Meanshift (sklearn).

## Status:
The problem descriped above has been answered. 

## List of challenges:
We have challenged ourselves with:
- Writing our own data module with functions to draw plots and sort in them.
- Clustering of our data.
- Prediction based on our data.
